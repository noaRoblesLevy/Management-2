# 📊 Business Process Analytics: Insurance Mailbox Optimization

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository documents the end-to-end analysis and optimization of the **Inbound Mailbox Routing & Indexing Process** for a mid-sized insurance company.

The company will remain anonymous throughout this project at their request for privacy reasons.

The project is divided into two major phases: analyzing the bottlenecks of the current manual workflow (**AS-IS**) and designing a fully automated future state (**TO-BE**) using AI and Robotics.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1\. 📉 AS-IS Analysis (Current State)

An in-depth audit of the existing manual process.

  * **Goal:** Identify root causes of delays (days) and indexing errors (15%).
  * **Key Artifacts:**
      * **Turtle Diagram:** Process scope and resource audit.
      * **SIPOC:** High-level view of inputs and suppliers.
      * **BPMN 2.0:** Detailed map of manual touchpoints.
      * **Fishbone & SWOT:** Root cause analysis of inefficiencies.

### 2\. 📈 TO-BE Design (Future State)

The proposed automated solution designed to replace the manual workflow.

  * **Goal:** Reduce lead times to hours and increase scalability.
  * **Solution Selected:** **Option B (Full Automation)** using IDAS (Intelligent Document Analysis) and RPA.
  * **Key Artifacts:**
      * **Weighted Criteria Matrix:** Strategic selection of the best solution.
      * **COPAFILT Analysis:** Feasibility study covering Costs, IT, and Legal impact.
      * **Automated Workflow Design:** Integration of AI/LLM for classification.

## 🛠️ Methodologies & Tools Used

This project applies industry-standard frameworks to drive data-driven decision-making:

  * **Process Mapping:** BPMN 2.0, SIPOC, Turtle Diagrams.
  * **Strategic Analysis:** SWOT, Ishikawa (Fishbone), Weighted Decision Matrix.
  * **Feasibility Study:** COPAFILT (Customer, Organisation, People, Admin, Finance, Information, Legal, Technology).
